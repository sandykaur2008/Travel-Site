Project Title

This project is called "My Travels" and the aim is to simply get myself comfortable with HTML and CSS, in conjunction with Bootstrap and Git. I just created a blog with entries on countries I have visited. 

Getting Started

If you want to be part of this, please request to be a collaborator on Github. username/repo name = sandykaur2008/training-lol-

This isn't meant to be a project for collaboration - more like a way for me to log my frustrations as I go through the process. 

Prerequisites

Aside from Git, you need to have a text editor (like Visual Studio Code) and a working browser. That's really it. To get setup with Git:
