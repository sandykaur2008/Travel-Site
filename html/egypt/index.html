              <p>Egypt was a destination I had been dying to visit for many, many years. My childhood friend is 
                Egytian and has family in Alexandria, so we'd grown up discussing this trip and were excited when 
                we were finally able to do it together. </p>

              <p>Our first few days were spent in Luxor, visiting ancient sites like the Hatshepsut and Karnak temples,
                and befriending locals. My friend, for example, befriended a local boatman who took us out onto the Nile 
                and helped us get tickets for a hot air balloon tour (which allowed us to see Hatshepsut from above)!</p>

              <p>After Luxor, we spent time with my friend's family in Alexandria. The family was incredibly sweet and hospitable. 
              They took us around all over, including to the Citadel of Qaitbay, the Alexandrian library, and to get tea
              by the sea!</p>

              <p>We spent our final days in Cairo and visting the Pyramids of Giza. We visited a bunch of sites in Cairo,
              including Tahrir Square, which has the Egyptian Museum nearby. Most memorable for me was the Mosque of Muhammad Ali 
              in the Saladin Citadel.</p>

              <p>The Pyramids of Giza were as impressive as I imagined they would be. I rode a camel to get
              there and it was honestly dreamlike. We also got to see the Sphinx, which was smaller than I thought it be but impressive
              nonetheless.</p>
