              <p>I went to Greece while I was studying abroad in Italy. I went on my own to the island of
                  Rhodes. I have to be honest - I did it wrong. I went by myself to a little island with not 
                  enough books on me and booked myself in a room with a broken TV. So, after I had seen everything
                  there was to see in about 2 days, I spent the next 3 bored out of my mind. Still, I'm glad I went
                  and had the experience. After all, I learned how to not travel!</p>

              <p>I visited the Old Town neighborhood, which had the really cool Palace of the Grand Master of the 
                  Knights of Rhodes and the really old Turkish mosque known as the Suleymaniye Mosque.</p>

              <p>My other adventures in Rhodes led me to the Acropolis  and to a really small aquarium at the tip of the island. 
                The aquarium was actually pretty cute. It was a pretty little island, but I hope to see more of Greece in the future (gotta
                go to Athens!).</p>
