        <p>I visited Argentina with a friend who has family in Buenos Aires. My friend's cousin lives in an apartment in the Caballito neighborhood,
          right next to the Parque Centenario. Since we went in October, it was spring in Argentina and lots of people would sit on the grass
          in the park and drink matte. 
          Our first few days in Buenos Aires centered on getting to know the lay of the land. We visited many neighborhoods, like Microcentro, Recoleta,
          and La Boca. The city is gorgeous and has Jacaranda trees all over the place. La Boca has the colorful Caminito, Microcentro has numerous buildings 
          of note, like Casa Rosada (housing the office of the President), and Recoleta has not only an awesome museum of waterworks (Palacio de las Aguas)
          but also the famous Recoleta cemetary, with mausoleums for such famous people as Eva Peron!
          Our last few days in Argentina were spent basking in sun at El Tigre (where I also gorged on steak and fries) and visiting El Ateneo, the massive bookshop in
          Buenos Aires. I made sure to buy a few books so I could brag I had shopped there.</p>
