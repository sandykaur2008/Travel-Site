              <p>I visited Berlin while I was working in France. My friend and I went in late December, so my memories
                are marred by the most bitter cold I ever did experience. Still, I'm glad I went! It was definitely worth
                it, especially to see the Berlin Wall in its modern state. I really liked that pieces of it were dispersed 
                throughout the city. It was actually pretty moving to look at and reflect on.</p>
              <img src="../../images/GermanyHolocaustMemorial.jpg" alt="Berlin's Holocaust Museum"> 
              <p>I felt similarly about the Holocaust Memorial, which was sobering to walk around in.</p>
              <img src="../../images/GermanyCurrywurst.jpg" alt="Currywurst - sausage with ketchup">
              <p>One thing I remember most about my trip to Berlin is currywurst - I ate so much I thought I was going to be 
                sick. I regret nothing!</p>
              <img src="../../images/GermanyBrandenburgGate.jpg" alt="Brandenburg Gate, Berlin">
              <p>We ended up spending the New Year in Berlin, which was a little terrifying, given fireworks
                are legal. People were setting them off every few seconds and I kept ducking, thinking I was getting shot at. Oh well! 
                At least there had been a giant fair near the Brandenburg Gate a few days prior, so it made up for it retroactively.</p>
