        <p>I visited Berlin while I was working in France. My friend and I went in late December, so my memories
          are marred by the most bitter cold I ever did experience. Still, I'm glad I went! It was definitely worth
          it, especially to see the Berlin Wall in its modern state. I really liked that pieces of it were dispersed 
          throughout the city. It was actually pretty moving to look at and reflect on. I felt similarly about the 
          Holocaust Memorial, which was sobering to walk around in. 
          One thing I remember most about my trip to Berlin is currywurst - I ate so much I thought I was going to be 
          sick. I regret nothing! We ended up spending the New Year in BErlin, which was a little terrifying, given fireworks
          are legal. People were setting them off every few seconds and I kept ducking, thinking I was getting shot at. Oh well! 
          At least there had been a giant fair near the Brandenburg Gate a few days prior, so it made up for it retroactively.</p>
