        <p> I went to Barcelona with a bunch of people I didn't know very well, but it was still fun. We spent the first day
          getting aclimated and walking around the Arc de Triomf. We ate a lot of tapas and also experienced the nightlife, which 
          was timed a little too late for my taste (I'm a grandma). My favorite parts were whenever we visited the architecure of
          Antoni Gaudi, who I just think is crazy and out there - in a good way. The inside of Sagrada Familia is unlike anything I've
          ever seen and I was taken aback to learn it has been under construction since it first started in 1882. I also greatly 
          enjoyed visited Casa Mila and wish I could live there! One can only dream. </p>
