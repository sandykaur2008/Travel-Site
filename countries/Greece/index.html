        <p>I went to Greece while I was studying abroad in Italy. I went on my own to the island of
          Rhodes. I have to be honest - I did it wrong. I went by myself to a little island with not 
          enough books on me and booked myself in a room with a broken TV. So, after I had seen everything
          there was to see in about 2 days, I spent the next 3 bored out of my mind. Still, I'm glad I went
          and had the experience. After all, I learned how to not travel!  
          I visited the Old Town neighborhood, which had the really cool Palace of the Grand Master of the 
          Knights of Rhodes and the really old Turkish mosque known as the Suleymaniye Mosque. My other adventures
          in Rhodes led me to the Acropolis  and to a really small aquarium at the tip of the island. The aquarium 
          was actually pretty cute. It was a pretty little island, but I hope to see more of Greece in the future (gotta
          go to Athens!). </p>
