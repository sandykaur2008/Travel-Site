      <p>I have spent many summers in Canada, as I have extensive family there on both coasts. One of my earliest memories 
        is of stepping onto the glass floor at CN Tower - I remember being frightened but also thrilled! When not in Toronto,
        I was passing time in Vancouver. My grandparents lived nearby in Abbotsford, which was for all intents and purposes a 
        mini-Punjab. Since it was a rural area near farmland, it was also pretty chill. Still, it was always nice to go back to 
        family in Vancouver and get reconnected with the rest of the world! 
        I would love to visit other parts of Canada, like Nova Scotia. I have been lucky enough to go to the Mont Tremblant resort
        in Quebec, but I didn't get a chance to really explore Montreal, which we only drove through.. There is so much more I have 
        yet to see!</p>
