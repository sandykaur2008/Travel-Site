      <p>If you know me, you know I am a bit of an Anglophile. I LOVE British television. I would honestly love 
        to one day live in London. I have been to London a few times, and the Tower Bridge is my favorite site. 
        I just had a really good day when we visited, and so I always think of it fondly!  The last time I went to 
        the UK, however, we focused on places other than London. I went down to Brighton, which I would also love to
        live in, it's such a pleasant place! We also went further north and visited Liverpool, where I was bowled over
        by the sculpture "Another Place" installed at Crosby Beach. We visited the beach after the sun had just set, 
        and it was something to behold. I would love to visit again and again at different times of the day. From Liverpool,
        we went further north to Scotland. I got to visit Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is one of the prettiest cities I have
        ever seen. I especially liked the Balmoral Hotel, which was so striking against the blue sky. I definitely also want
        to see more of Scotland - I look forward to one day visiting the highlands! </p>
