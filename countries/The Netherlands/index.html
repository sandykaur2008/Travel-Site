      <p>I went to the Netherlands right after my trip to Berlin. I went with the same friend who was with me in Berlin,
        and we both liked Amsterdam better. Our first few days were spent walking around Amsterdam and eating a lot of 
        stroopwafel. The canals were gorgeous at night. Dam Plaza was fun to visit, especially since we went shopping at 
        De Bijenkorf. We honeslty just walked around and had <em>ahem</em> fun. Other than Amsterdam, the windmills of Kinderdijk 
        was another one of our destinations and it was really a cute trip! </p>
