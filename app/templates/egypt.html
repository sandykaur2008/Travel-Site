            <p>Egypt was a destination I had been dying to visit for many, many
              years. My childhood friend is Egytian and has family in Alexandria, 
              so we'd grown up discussing this trip and were excited when 
              we were finally able to do it together.</p>

            <p>Our first few days were spent in Luxor, visiting ancient sites
              like the Hatshepsut and Karnak temples, the latter of which we 
              saw at night, when there is an impressive light show in several 
              languages! It was pretty crazy to think of all the mighty pharaohs
              that had these temples built in their name. I couldn't help but wonder
              what it must have been like to have all that power...</p>

            <p>As my friend is fluent in Arabic, we were fortunate enough to
              befriend locals. For example, we befriended a local boatman who 
              took us out onto the Nile and helped us get tickets for a hot air 
              balloon tour (which allowed us to see Hatshepsut from above)! He was
              also kind enough to welcome us to his home and host us for dinner. 
              The hospitality we experienced was truly something else.</p>

            <p>After Luxor, we spent time with my friend's family in Alexandria. 
              Her family was incredibly sweet and hospitable. They took us around 
              all over, including to the Citadel of Qaitbay, the Alexandrian library, 
              and to get tea by the sea!</p>

            <p>We spent our final days in Cairo. Aside from the pyramids (of course), 
              we visited a bunch of other sites, including Tahrir Square, 
              which has the Egyptian Museum nearby. It's a pretty huge place 
              with a crazy number of ancient artifacts.</p>

            <p>The most memorable site of Cairo for me was the Mosque of Muhammad 
              Ali, in the Saladin Citadel. It was gorgeous and overlooked the city, 
              so the views were stunning! I could have stayed there forever.</p>

            <p>The Pyramids of Giza were as impressive as I imagined they would be. 
              I rode a camel to get there and it was honestly dreamlike. We also got 
              to see the Sphinx, which was smaller than I thought it would be but 
              impressive nonetheless.</p>
