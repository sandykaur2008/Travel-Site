            <p> I studied abroad in Italy and even learned Italian pretty well!
                I have unfortunately forgetten much of it. I studied at the University
                of Florence and stayed with a sweet Italian family. The best way to 
                take in Florence was to go to the top of the Piazzale Michelangelo, 
                which is positioned high above the whole city and which we visited
                early in our stay.</p>

            <p>From there, you can see the Duomo (which is in a dense, intricate 
              area with one of the best pizza shops I have ever come across) and 
              Ponte Vecchio. Ponte Vecchio was really hard to visit because I wanted 
              to buy so many things! For most of my stay in Italy, however, I spent 
              the bulk of my money on pizza and gelato.</p>

            <p>Aside from Florence, we got to visit a bunch of other places. I went 
              to the Tuscan countryside and got tipsy at a wine tasting.</p>

            <p>I visited Venice, which was the city that first got me interested 
              in Italy to begin with. I bought a really cool Carnevale mask,
              the Plague Doctor model. </p>

            </figure> 
            <p>I also went to Pisa a few times, as it had an airport Ryanair used 
               for its flights, and I checked out Rome, though only for a day! At 
               least I got to see the Colosseum, which was both eerie and majestic. 
               I still need to go back to Italy, however, as I never did make it to 
               Milan or Sicily.</p>
