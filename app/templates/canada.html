            <p>I have spent many summers in Canada, as I have extensive family
              there on both coasts. One of my earliest memories is of stepping 
              onto the glass floor at CN Tower - I remember being frightened but 
              also thrilled!</p>

            <p>When in Canada, I am usually on the West Coast, in Vancouver. 
              My grandparents live in nearby Abbotsford, which is for all intents 
              and purposes a mini-Punjab. Since it's a rural area near farmland, 
              it's also pretty chill. Still, it's always nice to go back to 
              family in Vancouver and get reconnected with the rest of the world!</p>

              <p>One site I've visited many times with family is Stanley Park. I love 
                looking at the Totem Poles and taking in all the details.</p>

            <p>I would love to visit other parts of Canada, like Nova Scotia. 
              I have been lucky enough to go to the Mont Tremblant resort in 
              Quebec, but I didn't get a chance to really explore Montreal, 
              which we only drove through. There is so much more I have 
              yet to see!</p>
