            <p>I went to Ireland while studying abroad in Italy. I mostly stayed 
              in Dublin, venturing out to see Howth. Dublin honestly has some of 
              the nicest people I have ever met. People would randomly wave at me,
              which was confusing at first. It was really fun to vist the Guinness 
              Factory and get tipsy in the middle of the day. It was also really 
              fun to do a pub crawl and meet other tourists enjoying the city.</p>

            </figure> 
            <p>In Dublin, I got to see the Spire and visit Kilmainham Gaol. The 
              latter was as interesting as it was depressing, but I guess that's 
              a normal reaction to a prison.</p>

              <figcaption>Feeding Swan!</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>St. Stephen's Green was the site that really left an impression on me.
              It was just so pretty, with huge swan that people could feed! It was 
              like something out of a book.</p>

            </figure> 
            <p> I also really liked Howth, which I found to be beautiful. I really wish 
              I could have seen more of the Irish coast, but I guess I will just have 
              to go back some day! </p>
