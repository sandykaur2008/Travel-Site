            <p>India is a place I really haven't explored. I have been there 
              a few times now, but always with family and always to Punjab. 
              Whenever I go, I end up sitting in some relative's house. I 
              know I have been lucky to see the famous Golden Temple a few 
              times, but I would like to see and do more in India. I hope to one
              day take a really long tour of the whole country!</p>

            <p>In terms of what I <em>have</em> experienced in India, I can say 
              that I have eaten a lot of delicious food. My favorite thing to eat 
              the last time I was there (in the city of Ludhiana) was Golgappa. 
              God, I ate so many. It was blissful.</p>

            <p>The last time I went I was lucky enough to experience some new 
              things - I got to go to Rajasthan and also see people race oxen. 
              Though I did not visit any real historic sites in Rajasthan 
              (again, we were stuck in someone's house), I did get to see 
              traditional Rajasthani dress, which was striking.</p>

            <p>I also got to see a lot of farmland, including mustard fields,
              which were so pretty as to look photoshopped in pictures. I 
              have enjoyed my past visits to India, but I am definitely looking 
              forward to doing more intensive travel on my own! </p>
