            <p>We went to Uruguay when we went to Argentina, since they border each
               other. Uruguay may be small, but it was really interesting. We visited 
               Colonia del Sacramento, an ancient village, and Montevideo, the capital.
              Colonia del Sacramento had a bunch of buildings that were unlike 
              anything I'd seen before.</p>

              <figcaption>This bench tho</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The buildings were interesting, but the benches in Colonia were 
              something I could not stop staring at - I have never seen such 
              pretty benches! I think NYC needs to step up its bench game.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Calle de los Suspiros attracted a lot of tourists and I could 
              see why - there was certainly something romantic about it!</p>

            <p>In Montevideo, we walking all over the place and checked out 
              Plaza Independencia. All in all, a nice place to visit!</p>
